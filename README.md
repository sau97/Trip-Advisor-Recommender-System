# Enhanced-Trip-Advisor-Recommender-System

This was my final project during my Fall semester at UT Austin for my Analytics for Unstructured Data course.
We scraped 4000 reviews and descriptions using Selenium off the Trip Advisor Website for 400 destinations across the globe.
We calculated the similarity between the reviews and descriptions provided by the business owners/tripadvisor.
Then we performed the sentiment analysis on the reviews and provided more accurate descriptions using topic modeling.
